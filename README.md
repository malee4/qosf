# QOSF
The following repository was created as a part of the screening task for Cohort 9 of the QOSF Mentorship program. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Melody Lee.

## Running the File
To run the file, ensure you are in the same directory as the main.py file for the QOSF repository and run the following command in Terminal:
```
python main.py
```
You will be prompted to enter a list of integers:

```
Please enter the list of numbers you wish to convert, separated by spaces: 
```
Enter the integers as follows, and press the "Enter" key on your keyboard when done:
```
Please enter the list of numbers you wish to convert, separated by spaces: 1 2 3
```

The program will output a list of integers that have been converted into all even numbers.
```
Converting [1, 2, 3]
Even list: [2, 2, 2]
```

## Initial Prompt
The prompt from the QOSF Cohort 9 Screening Tasks is as follows:
> Design a quantum algorithm that when given numbers of range [1,n) and are odd convert them into even numbers, and they must stay in the same range so they cannot be less than 1 nor greater than n. n = 2^k where k is the number of qubits you are going to use.
